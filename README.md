# DESCRIPITION #

Traction Tools – Fun with APIs
The hiring managers at Traction Tools is having a hard time coming up with work prompts and got very
lazy with this one. We want to see you flex your React + API skills. Please build a fun web app with a
public API (REST, GraphQL, SOAP, whatever). Here is a list of some public GraphQL APIs.
https://github.com/APIs-guru/graphql-apis

Please build an application based on the following criteria:

A simple React app. We’re not looking for a backend.

We’re not very interested in styling because we have a UI/UX team for that.

The application is meant to showcase your skills.

Build something fun.

Timebox yourself to 4 hours.

Please write some useful unit or integration tests.

We encourage you to go above and beyond these specific requirements in an area you feel
passionate about.

When you are finished, please add your code to Github and email us a link to the project. We’ll
schedule some time for you to demo your application.

We’re happy to answer any question you have, please send us an email if you need clarification.
We expect this programming assignment to take around 4 hours to complete.
